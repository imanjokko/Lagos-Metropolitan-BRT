# Lagos-Metropolitan-BRT
This was a survey conducted by Obukofe Uririoghene, using SQL queries to answer questions.
In this survey, we were asked to create a normalized database schema using codes provided by the survey author, and then, we proceeded to answer questions he provided using SQL queries.
After answering the five questions he posed, we are asked to further analyze the dataset by coming up with our own questions.
